# Amadeus-Project
 
In this project, I worked on creating a flight search application. The main focus points and steps taken were:

Basic HTML Structure Creation: A basic HTML structure was created for the flight search application. This structure included form fields for users to enter flight information (from, to, departure and return dates) and a search button.

Styling and Design: The application's user interface was styled using CSS. This was done to make the interface visually appealing and improve user experience.

Mock Data Usage: Instead of real flight data, static (mock) airport and flight data were used in the project. These data were a simple JavaScript array containing real airport codes and city names. However, there were some limitations in dynamically filtering and displaying these data in the user interface.

Dynamic List Creation: A dynamic list was added for users to make airport selections. This list displayed airports matching the text entered by the user.

Filtering Functionality: A filtering function was planned to facilitate airport selection, but the full implementation and testing of this function were not achieved. The goal of creating a dynamic list filtering airports based on user input was not fully realized.

Flight Search Functionality: When users filled out the form and pressed the 'Search Flights' button, the application had functionality to search for suitable flights among the mock flight data and display them.

Loading Animation: A loading animation was planned during the flight search process. This was important for providing visual feedback to users during the search. However, there were some challenges in correctly executing and displaying the loading animation.

Debugging and Improvements: Various errors and issues emerged while developing the application. Various code modifications and improvements were made to fix these errors and enhance the user experience.

User Interface Adjustments: Additional adjustments were made to make the user interface more user-friendly and visually appealing. For example, improvements were made on the section displaying flight results, user input fields, and buttons.

The project used the basic elements of web development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Focus was given to user experience, interface design, and dynamic content management. This project serves as a good example of how the development process of a web application progresses.
